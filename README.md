- **Animated VU meter** — L/R bar animation with elapsed timer while playing
- **Progress bar** — shows elapsed / total time as a live fill bar
- **Pause & seek** — pause with `Space`/`q`, seek with `←`/`→` arrow keys

- **History mid-playback** — press `h` to stop and pick from your recently played tracks
- **Play history** — `sc history` lists recently played tracks with an interactive replay picker
- **Download** tracks and playlists via yt-dlp (`mp3`, `m4a`, `opus`, `flac`)

- No login required — uses the public SoundCloud API

## Requirements

| Dependency | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Python ≥ 3.10 | Runtime |
| `mpv` *(recommended)* | Audio playback |
| `ffplay` or `vlc` | Alternative players |
| `ffmpeg` | Required by yt-dlp for format conversion |

Install a player on Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install mpv          # recommended
# or: sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/soundcloud-cli
cd soundcloud-cli

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .
```

The `sc` command is now available inside the virtual environment.  
To activate it in future sessions:
```bash
source /path/to/soundcloud-cli/.venv/bin/activate
```

## Usage

### Search and play interactively

```bash
sc search "bicep glue"
```

Displays a results table, then prompts:
```
Enter a track number to play [1–10], or press Enter / q to quit.
  Play> 2
```

Pick a number → track streams with the VU meter.  
After it finishes or you stop it, the prompt returns so you can pick another.

```bash
sc search "four tet" --type users       # search users
sc search "boiler room" --type playlists --limit 5
sc search "bicep" --list                # print results only, no prompt
```

### Stream the top result immediately

```bash
sc stream "bicep glue"
```

### Play a specific URL

```bash
sc play https://soundcloud.com/feelmybicep/bicep-glue-clip
```

### Playback controls

| `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` | Exit |

**While paused:**

| Key | Action |

### Download

> **⚠️ Legal disclaimer**  
> Downloading tracks is only permitted when the artist has explicitly enabled the free download option on their track, or the content is released under a licence that allows copying (e.g. Creative Commons).  
> Downloading copyrighted content without permission violates [SoundCloud's Terms of Use](https://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use) and may infringe copyright law in your jurisdiction.  
> **Use this feature only for content you have the right to download. You are solely responsible for how you use it.**

```bash
sc download https://soundcloud.com/feelmybicep/bicep-glue-clip
sc download https://soundcloud.com/feelmybicep/bicep-glue-clip --format opus
sc download https://soundcloud.com/feelmybicep/bicep-glue-clip -o ~/Music

Playlists and sets are supported.

## Project layout

```
sc_cli/
├── __init__.py
├── api.py      ← SoundCloud API v2 client (auto-scrapes & caches client_id)
├── player.py   ← subprocess player + VU meter + pause/seek/search/history keys
└── main.py     ← Click CLI commands
pyproject.toml
```

## Notes

- The SoundCloud `client_id` is scraped automatically from their public JS bundle and cached at `~/.cache/sc_cli/client_id` for 24 hours. It refreshes itself on expiry or on a 401/403 response.
- Playback is unofficial/streaming only — tracks that are not publicly streamable will not work.
- Downloads go through yt-dlp; ffmpeg must be installed for format conversion.
